Topaz had one of the most urban and most homogeneous populations with nearly its entire inmate population coming from the San Francisco Bay Area. Topaz is perhaps best known as the site of the fatal shooting of an inmate by an overzealous camp sentry in April 1943 and for its art school, which included a faculty roster of notable Issei and Nisei artists. It was also the site of significant protest against registration in the spring of 1943 and of a variety of labor disputes.

First, it was jointly managed by the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), an arrangement that was troubled and that ended with the OIA withdrawing by the beginning of 1944. Secondly, it was divided into three separate camps arranged in a line about three miles apart. It likely had the most rural population, its inmates hailing mostly from farming areas of southern, central and coastal California. Finally, about 2/3 of its population came directly to Poston without going to an assembly center first, something that set it apart from all other WRA camps with the exception of Manzanar.

Relative to other camps, there was little overt unrest at Amache, and Amache had a low number of inmates who gave ""no-no"" answers to the ""loyalty questionnaire"" and a large number of volunteers for military service, which fueled its reputation as ""good"" camp.
